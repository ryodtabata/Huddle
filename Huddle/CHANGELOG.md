### 10. `src/firebase/publicChatService.js`

**Status: Enhanced Data Structure & Error Handling**

#### Changes Made:

- **Profile Image Support**: Added senderProfileImage parameter to sendPublicMessage
- **Enhanced Message Data**: Messages now include profile image URLs
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added document existence checks and graceful error recovery
- **Better User Experience**: Better user identification in group chats and prevents crashes

#### Key Improvements:

- ✅ Stores profile images with messages for display
- ✅ Enhanced message data structure
- ✅ Better user identification in group conversations
- ✅ **Fixed critical bug**: Checks if chat document exists before updating
- ✅ **Graceful error handling**: Message still sends even if chat update fails
- ✅ **Better error messages**: More descriptive errors for missing chats
- ✅ **URGENT FIX**: Fixed "unsubscribe is not a function" error in message subscriptions

#### Bug Fix Details:

**Issue**: Error "No document to update" when sending messages to group chats
**Root Cause**: Attempting to update chat documents that don't exist or were deleted
**Solution**:

- Check document existence before attempting updates
- Graceful fallback when chat document update fails
- Message still sends successfully even if chat update fails
- Clear error messages when chat no longer exists

**NEW ENHANCEMENT**: Auto-recreation of proximity chats

- **Advanced Issue**: Users getting "Chat no longer exists" errors for proximity-based chats
- **Smart Solution**: Automatically recreate proximity chats when they're missing
- **How it works**:
  - Detects proximity chat IDs (format: `location_lat_lng`)
  - Extracts coordinates from chat ID
  - Recreates chat document with proper structure
  - Adds user as participant and sends message successfully
- **User Experience**: Seamless messaging even when chat documents are corrupted or deleted
- **Fallback**: Clear error message for non-proximity chats that can't be recreated

**LATEST FIX**: Automatic participant management & Multi-collection support

- **Issue**: Non-owner users unable to send messages to group chats + "Chat no longer exists" errors
- **Root Cause**:
  - Users not properly added to chat participants list
  - App using both `groupChats` and `publicChats` collections but service only checking one
- **Solution**:
  - Automatically add users as participants when they send messages
  - Check participant status before sending each message
  - Update both participants array and participantNames mapping
  - **NEW**: Smart collection detection - checks both `groupChats` and `publicChats` collections
  - **NEW**: Dynamic message routing based on chat location
  - Enhanced debugging with detailed console logs
- **Benefits**:
  - Any user can send messages to proximity chats without explicit joining
  - Seamless messaging across both old and new chat systems
  - Robust error handling with detailed debugging information

**CRITICAL FIX**: Subscription function error resolved

- **Issue**: "TypeError: unsubscribe is not a function (it is Object)" causing app crashes
- **Root Cause**: subscribeToPublicMessages was made async but React expected synchronous unsubscribe function
- **Solution**:
  - Restructured function to return synchronous unsubscribe function immediately
  - Collection detection happens asynchronously in background
  - Proper error handling for both collection checks
  - Maintains real-time message listening while fixing the crash
- **Result**: App no longer crashes when opening/closing chat conversations

**NEW UPDATE**: Enhanced Dark Mode Profile UI

- **Issue**: Profile cards and profile pages too dark/hard to see in night mode
- **Improvements Made**:
  - **Profile Screen**: Added dark gray content wrapper (#2a2a2a) in dark mode
  - **Profile Cards**: Enhanced with darker gray backgrounds (#3a3a3a) and borders (#4a4a4a)
  - **Bio Containers**: Better contrast with #2a2a2a background in dark mode
  - **Profile Modal**: Dark-themed modal background and close button styling
  - **Button Components**: Enhanced visibility with #3a3a3a backgrounds in dark mode
- **Visual Benefits**:
  - Much better visibility and contrast in dark mode
  - Maintains clean look in light mode
  - Improved readability for all text elements
  - Better component separation and definition
