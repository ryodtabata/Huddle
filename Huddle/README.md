need to implmenet the public chats page
edit profile is buggy
settigs has too many options i dont care about

need to set up the messaging/group chat services -PRIORITY

BUGS:
lots of viewing bugs depending if on phone or web, or i assume android.

TESTING:
location stuff seems weird still
radius decision---> for now max -> then make it editable
decision about how often api calls should be made ? best way to do it with limited write/fetches
